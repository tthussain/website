{% include base_path %}

I am a postdoctoral Researcher at Bio-Acoustic Signal Processing (Bio-ASP) Lab, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica (working remotely). 
I am involved in research related to Speech and Audio Signal Processing, Deep Learning for Audio and Speech Signal Processing, Hearing Assistive Technology, and Multimodal 
Speech Signal and Information Processing that includes research related to models, algorithms, and practices for making sense of complex audio data in real-world single-source 
and multi-source environments. 

I got my Ph.D. from the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, and the College of Science (Department of Computer Science), National Chengchi University, Taiwan. 
During my Ph.D., I worked in the Biomedical Acoustic Signal Processing (Bio-ASP) lab of Prof. Yu Tsao at Academia Sinica, Taiwan, where I investigated the hierarchical 
extreme learning machine (HELM) for speech signal processing and proposed various extreme learning machine-based unimodal and multimodal frameworks for efficient learning.
