<h3 id="summary">Project Description</h3>
We have developed two independent projects that are low­ cost non-
invasive techniques to measure cognitive function. One utilises
Quantitative EEG and one uses a virtual doctor that analyses speech
using automatic speech recognition. Both use machine learning
algorithms to distinguish Alzheimer’s disease. This project funds a feasibility study in Nairobi, Kenya for a
data recording and feasibility study.
